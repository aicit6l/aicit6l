*SOC Agent | Cloud & Security Enthusiast*

> hi!
> I’m a SOC Agent based in Johannesburg.

I currently work in a Security Operations Centre, where I monitor security alerts, investigate potential threats, and support incident response processes in live environments. This role has given me practical exposure to how security events surface, how alerts are triaged, and how security teams operate under real-world conditions.

Alongside my SOC work, I’m actively building skills in cloud security, focusing on securing AWS and Azure environments. My interests include identity and access management (IAM), cloud logging and monitoring and web application firewalls (WAF) within cloud infrastructure.

This GitHub documents my hands-on labs, learning notes and security projects as I work toward cloud-focused security roles.
