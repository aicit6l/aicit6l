> ☁️ *SOC Agent | Cloud & Security Enthusiast*

Hi, I'm Nandi.

I’m a SOC Agent based in Johannesburg.

I currently work in a Security Operations Centre, where I monitor security alerts, investigate potential threats, and support incident response processes in live environments. This role has given me practical exposure to how security events surface, how alerts are triaged, and how security teams operate under real-world conditions.

This GitHub documents my hands-on labs, learning notes and security projects as I work toward cloud-focused security roles.
